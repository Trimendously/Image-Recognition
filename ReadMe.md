## Installation
Make sure python is correctly installed, you can go here for help: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Then simply double click the main.py file or run at the command line: 

``` bash
$ python main.py

```

* Please note that if not installed the packages are rather large so try to have around 2Gb free of storage. As such a fresh installation may take a few minutes.

## Usage
Given a dataset (https://pytorch.org/vision/0.9/datasets.html#cifar) this program is able to identify images from the dataset with varying accuracy.


## Contributing
This is an old project that was intended for learning so I don't really feel the need for outside contribution.
